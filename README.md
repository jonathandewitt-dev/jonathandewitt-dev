# Nice to Meet You!

Hi, I'm Jon!

I'm a full stack software engineer with a particular interest in the front end. Having worked heavily with the native platform and all three major frameworks - Angular, Vue, and most of all React, I have a range of experience that has prompted me to explore beyond the boundaries of my day job.

For a couple years, that meant serving clients at my own company, where I could dictate the cutting edge technology we used in our stack, and build software I could be proud of. While the experience and freedom was fantastic for enriching my life and learning invaluable lessons, I chose to rejoin the workforce as an employee because client work was not free of its own challenges. That said, I still tinker in my business on the side, building in-house SaaS and passion projects.

In my spare time, I also like to seek out conversations with industry leaders. I've had quite a few enlightening exchanges with folks like "Uncle Bob" and Jon Kern of the Agile Manifesto, Rich Harris of Svelte, Dan Abramov of React, Tab Atkins of Chrome and champion of CSS Flexbox and Grid, Lea Verou of Font Awesome, Alex Russell of Blink, and the list goes on. Whether I'm agreeing or challenging them, I always enjoy the conversation and I have learned a lot from this whole endeavor.

Some of my recent accomplishments include:

- Published [Thunderous](https://thunderous.dev/), a library for authoring functional web components using signals.

- Published [React-Shadow-Scope](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-shadow-scope), a library for writing shadow DOM components in React.

- Wrote a successful [article about Agile](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/agile-sucks-8e504ed68ce7) for Git Connected's "Level Up Coding" publication.

- Developed [Collab Hour](https://collabhouragile.org/), a new Agile framework that strives for simplicity.
