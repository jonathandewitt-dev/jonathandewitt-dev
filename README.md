# Nice to Meet You!

Hi, I'm Jon!

I'm a full-stack software engineer with deep expertise in front-end development. Having worked heavily with the native platform and all three major frameworks - Angular, Vue, and most of all React, I have a range of experience in both corporate and entrepreneurial settings.

For several years, I ran my own consultancy called Thunder Solutions, where I built cutting-edge applications and architected robust solutions for a diverse range of clients. This journey taught me invaluable lessons in leadership, technical strategy, and business. Currently, I channel that experience into my work as a software engineer, while continuing to develop in-house SaaS tools and passion projects.

I thrive on exchanging ideas with industry leaders and have gained unique insights from engaging with the engineers behind Lit, Svelte, React, and the w3c spec. These conversations have not only deepened my understanding but have also inspired innovations in my own projects.

Some of my recent accomplishments include:

- Published [Thunderous](https://thunderous.dev/), a library for authoring functional web components using signals.

- Published [React-Shadow-Scope](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-shadow-scope), a library for writing shadow DOM components in React.

- Wrote a popular [article about Agile](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/agile-sucks-8e504ed68ce7) for Git Connected's "Level Up Coding" publication.

- Developed [Collab Hour](https://collabhouragile.org/), a lightweight Agile framework emphasizing simplicity and collaboration.

I'm always eager to exchange ideas and create impactful solutions. Let's connect!
