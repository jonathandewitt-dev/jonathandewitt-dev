# Nice to Meet You!

I'm Jonathan DeWitt, but you can call me Jon.

I'm a software engineer and artist rolled into one person. In 2020 I founded [Thunder Solutions](https://github.com/thunder-solutions) and began pursuing that full time in 2021. I'm passionate about constant learning, and I love to tinker with experimental ideas on the cutting edge.

My OSS contributions include state management, accessibility, and WC with DSD. I've also begun venturing into the wilds of existing open source, actively engaging in discussions and PRs.

Recently, I've become a regular contributor to Medium, publishing tech articles such as:

- [SCAAR - Software Design Principles for CSS](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/scaar-software-design-principles-for-css-d503ab60672c)
- [AIR - Naming CSS Color Variables](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/air-naming-css-color-variables-437cb4d261a6)
- [Modern-Day Separation of Concerns](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/modern-day-separation-of-concerns-74e79ff87767)
- [Mastering Presentation Components](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/mastering-presentation-components-614e847efbce)

But that's all the boring stuff, what about me personally? I don't take myself too seriously. I'll try (and probably fail) to make you laugh, so just pity laugh if you want me to stop - fair warning.

I love to talk about anime and music, play social games on Steam, but most of all, I like to host a good party to bring people together! In my free time, I like to do all the fun artist things across the whole multimedia realm - like digital drawing, animation, video, music production, and just whatever!

If the code or hobbies intrigue you, feel free to visit me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jon_dewitt_ts) or watch me code cool stuff live on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/code_e_pendant)!
